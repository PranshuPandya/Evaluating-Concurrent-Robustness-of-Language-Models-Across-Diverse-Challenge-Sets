Premise:  The urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi).  The municipality of Heraklion is 244.6 km 2  (94.4 sq mi).  The municipal unit of Heraklion is 109.0 km 2  (42.1 sq mi).  The highest elevation of Heraklion is 33 m (108 ft). 
Hypothesis: The urban area doesn't cover over 90 , 000 square miles .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the coverage of the urban area. As stated in the premise, the urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi). 87.095 square miles is the urban area which satisfies the hypothesis of not covering over 90,000 miles as 87,095 is not greater than 90,000. The answer is Yes.

Hypothesis: Kazakh Khanate only practiced Islam.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce which religions are practiced in Kazakh Khanate (country). The premise gives us no information of the same and it isn't very common knowledge either. Hence we are unable to make an inference of the hypothesis. The answer is Neutral.

Premise:    The federal and islamic republic of comoros was on 24 May 1978.  The protectorate of the comoros was on 6 September 1887.  The overseas territory was on 27 October 1946.  The state of comoros was on 22 December 1961.   
Hypothesis: Union of the Comoros was once the State of Comoros, and before that the Protectorate of the Comoros.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the nature of Union of the Comoros and what it was called through time along with the timeline. The premise states that it was once the Protectorate of Comoros from 6 September 1887, it was then overseas territory from 27 October 1946, then it was the State of Comoros from 22 December 1961. It was Finally the federal and Islamic republic of Comoros from 24 May 1978.

The producer of Carrie & Lowell is Thomas Bartlett.  
Hypothesis: More of Carrie & Lowell was not produced in the hotel room in Oregon than any other studio .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce in which locations Carrie & Lowell was produced and for how long. Although the premise mentions the locations, it provides no indication of how much time was spent in these locations and how much of Carrie & Lowell was produced in these places. We can't make a clear inference. The answer is neutral.

Premise:    Jerusalem is a city.  The jewish of Jerusalem is 64%.  The time zone of Jerusalem is UTC+02:00 (IST, PST).  The area code of Jerusalem is +972-2.   
Hypothesis: Christians comprise a big part of the population of Jerusalem.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the population division in Jerusalem. As stated in the premise, Jewish (religion) constitutes 64 percent of the population in Jerusalem. Hence the hypothesis must be false as the Christians(religion) can't possibly constitute a big part of the population, as the majority is taken up by the Jewish. The answer is No.

Premise:    The born of Dennis Gabor is Günszberg Dénes , (1900-06-05)5 June 1900 , Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary.  Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979(1979-02-09) (aged 78) , London, England.

Hypothesis: Dennis Gabor's wife didn't outlive him by two years .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce how long Dennis Gabor lived in comparison to his wife. The premise states that Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979. It also states that his wife was Marjorie Louise Butler who died in 1981, this can be understood from the range 1911-1981 given next to her name.

Premise:    The total area of Catania is 312,505.  Catania was saint day on February 5.  The time zone of Catania is UTC+1 (CET).  The summer (dst) of Catania is UTC+2 (CEST).   
Hypothesis: Caatnia lies west af te prie merdiian agnd does not recognize daily savinJs time.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "Catania lies west of the prime meridian and does not recogniz daily savings time.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce the location of Catania with respect to the prime meridian and whether it recognizes daily savings time. The premise clearly states that the time zone in Catania is UTC+1. This must mean that it is to the east of the prime meridian. Hence the corrected hypothesis is false. The answer is No.

Premise:    Kazakh Khanate is a country.  The common languages of Kazakh Khanate is Kazakh language.  The khan of Kazakh Khanate are Janibek Khan Kerei Khan  (first) (1465-1480), Kenesary Khan (last) (1841-1847).  The established  was on 1465.   
Hypothesis: Kazakh Khanate only practiced Islam.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce which religions are practiced in Kazakh Khanate (country). The premise gives us no information of the same and it isn't very common knowledge either. Hence we are unable to make an inference of the hypothesis. The answer is Neutral.

Premise:    The federal and islamic republic of comoros was on 24 May 1978.  The protectorate of the comoros was on 6 September 1887.  The overseas territory was on 27 October 1946.  The state of comoros was on 22 December 1961.   
Hypothesis: Union of the Comoros was once the State of Comoros, and before that the Protectorate of the Comoros.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the nature of Union of the Comoros and what it was called through time along with the timeline. The premise states that it was once the Protectorate of Comoros from 6 September 1887, it was then overseas territory from 27 October 1946, then it was the State of Comoros from 22 December 1961. It was Finally the federal and Islamic republic of Comoros from 24 May 1978. Hence the hypothesis is indeed true that the Union of Comoros was earlier the State of Comoros and the Protectorate of the Comoros before that. The answer is yes.

Premise:    Ctrl is a album.  Ctrl was released on June 9, 2017 (2017-06-09).  The studio of Ctrl are No Excuses, The Lake House in Michigan, EngineEars, Platinum Sounds, Top Dawg House of Pain, Josef Leimberg's studios, Windmark, 1500 or Nothin' Studios.  The label of Ctrl are Top Dawg, RCA.   
Hypothesis: Ctrl Pas SZA's debwt studio albuHm.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "Ctrl was SZA's debut studio album.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce if Ctrl was made by SZA and if it was his first album. Although the premise states that Ctrl was made by SZA, it does not state if it was indeed his first or debut album and we can't infer the same either. The answer is Neutral.

Premise:    Jerusalem is a city.  The jewish of Jerusalem is 64%.  The time zone of Jerusalem is UTC+02:00 (IST, PST).  The area code of Jerusalem is +972-2.   
Hypothesis: Christians comprise a big part of the population of Jerusalem.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the population division in Jerusalem. As stated in the premise, Jewish (religion) constitutes 64 percent of the population in Jerusalem. Hence the hypothesis must be false as the Christians(religion) can't possibly constitute a big part of the population, as the majority is taken up by the Jewish. The answer is No.

Premise:    The year of Jupiter and Io is c. 1532-1533.  The medium of Jupiter and Io is Oil on canvas.  The dimensions of Jupiter and Io is 163.5 cm  70.5 cm (64.4 in  27.8 in).  The location of Jupiter and Io is Kunsthistorisches Museum.    
Hypothesis: A it's widest point, Juptier and I wa morre htan five feet long.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "At it's widest point, Jupiter and Io was more than five feet long.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce how long Jupiter and lo was or get some bounds on the same. As stated by the premise, it can be understood that Jupiter and Lo is a painting (medium Oil on Canvas) with dimensions 163.5 cm by 70.5 cm. So it's widest point is at least 163.5 cm which is roughly 5.34 feet by common knowledge. This is indeed greate than 5 feet and so this impleis the hypothesis is clearly true. The answer is Yes.

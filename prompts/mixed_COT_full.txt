Hypothesis: Bruce Lee lived in Jackson at the time of his death.
To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce where Bruce Lee lived at the time of his death. Although the premise mentions that he died at Kowloon Tong, British Hong Kong and that his resting place (burial) is at Lake View Cemetery in the United States (US), it makes no mention of his place of living during his death. We can't make a clear inference. Answer is Neutral.

Premise:    The born of Dennis Gabor is Günszberg Dénes , (1900-06-05)5 June 1900 , Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary.  Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979(1979-02-09) (aged 78) , London, England.  The spouse(s) of Dennis Gabor is Marjorie Louise Butler ( m. 1936) (1911-1981).  The awards of Dennis Gabor was on FRS (1956), Young Medal and Prize (1967), Rumford Medal (1968), IEEE Medal of Honor (1970), Nobel Prize in Physics (1971).   
Hypothesis: Dennis Gabor's wife didn't outlive him by two years .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce how long Dennis Gabor lived in comparison to his wife. The premise states that Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979. It also states that his wife was Marjorie Louise Butler who died in 1981, this can be understood from the range 1911-1981 given next to her name. Therefore the hypothesis stating that Dennis Gabor's wife did not outlive him by to years is false. The answer is No.

Premise:    The federal and islamic republic of comoros was on 24 May 1978.  The protectorate of the comoros was on 6 September 1887.  The overseas territory was on 27 October 1946.  The state of comoros was on 22 December 1961.   
Hypothesis: Union of the Comoros was once the State of Comoros, and before that the Protectorate of the Comoros.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the nature of Union of the Comoros and what it was called through time along with the timeline. The premise states that it was once the Protectorate of Comoros from 6 September 1887, it was then overseas territory from 27 October 1946, then it was the State of Comoros from 22 December 1961. It was Finally the federal and Islamic republic of Comoros from 24 May 1978. Hence the hypothesis is indeed true that the Union of Comoros was earlier the State of Comoros and the Protectorate of the Comoros before that. The answer is yes.

Premise:    The total area of Catania is 312,505.  Catania was saint day on February 5.  The time zone of Catania is UTC+1 (CET).  The summer (dst) of Catania is UTC+2 (CEST).   
Hypothesis: Caatnia lies west af te prie merdiian agnd does not recognize daily savinJs time.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "Catania lies west of the prime meridian and does not recognize daily savings time.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce the location of Catania with respect to the prime meridian and whether it recognizes daily savings time. The premise clearly states that the time zone in Catania is UTC+1. This must mean that it is to the east of the prime meridian. Hence the corrected hypothesis is false. The answer is No.

Premise:  Carrie & Lowell was released on March 31, 2015 (2015-03-31).  The recorded of Carrie & Lowell is Mid-2014.  The studio of Carrie & Lowell are Flora (Portland, Oregon), Black Watch (Norman, Oklahoma), April Base (Eau Claire, Wisconsin), Pat Dillett's studio (Midtown Manhattan), Stevens' office (Dumbo, Brooklyn), Hotel room (Klamath Falls, Oregon).  The producer of Carrie & Lowell is Thomas Bartlett.  
Hypothesis: More of Carrie & Lowell was not produced in the hotel room in Oregon than any other studio .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce in which locations Carrie & Lowell was produced and for how long. Although the premise mentions the locations, it provides no indication of how much time was spent in these locations and how much of Carrie & Lowell was produced in these places. We can't make a clear inference. The answer is neutral.

Premise:    The country of Jodhpur is India.  The settled of Jodhpur is 1459.  The founded by of Jodhpur is Rao Jodha of Mandore.  The named for of Jodhpur is Rao Jodha.    
Hypothesis: Jodhpur is a city that dates back over 2000 years.
To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce when Jodhpur was founded and obtain some bounds on it's existence period. The premise clearly states that Jodhpur as a city came to be settled in 1459. Hence it is incorrect to say that it dates back over 2000 years. The hypothesis is false. Answer is no.

Premise:  I and the Village is a painting.  The artist of I and the Village is Marc Chagall.  The medium of I and the Village is Oil on canvas.  The location of I and the Village is Museum of Modern Art, NY.

Hypothesis: I'm So Sick was recorded in in 2365.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce when was "I'm So Sick" was recorded. We can see from the premise that "I'm So Sick" was recorded in 2005, where as in the hypothesis it mentions the year 2365. So the hypothesis contradicts the premise and thus the answer for this should be No.

Premise:  The urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi).  The municipality of Heraklion is 244.6 km 2  (94.4 sq mi).  The municipal unit of Heraklion is 109.0 km 2  (42.1 sq mi).  The highest elevation of Heraklion is 33 m (108 ft). 
Hypothesis: The urban area doesn't cover over 90 , 000 square miles .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the coverage of the urban area. As stated in the premise, the urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi). 87.095 square miles is the urban area which satisfies the hypothesis of not covering over 90,000 miles as 87,095 is not greater than 90,000. The answer is Yes.

Premise:    Interior is a painting.  The artist of Interior is Edgar Degas.  The medium of Interior is Oil on canvas.  The location of Interior is Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Hypothesis: Ctrl Pas SZA's debwt studio albuHm.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "Ctrl was SZA's debut studio album.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce if Ctrl was made by SZA and if it was his first album. Although the premise states that Ctrl was made by SZA, it does not state if it was indeed his first or debut album and we can't infer the same either. The answer is Neutral.

Premise:    The spouse(s) of Fawad Khan is Sadaf Khan ( m.  2005).  The labels of Fawad Khan are Lips Music (2002 - 2007) , Independent (2009 - 2015).

Hypothesis: Fawad Khan married his spouse before he became active in the entertainment industry.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce when Fawad Khan was married and when he became active in the entertainment industry. The premise states that Fawad Khan has been married since 2005 this is what m. 2005 refers to. Also the premise states that Fawad Khan has had a label Lips Music from 2002-2007. This means that he was active in the entertainment industry since 2002 or before and got married in 2005. Hence the hypothesis stating that he married his spouse before becoming active in the entertainment industry is false since 2005 (year when he married spouse) is greater than 2002 (year since he was active in entertainment industry).The answer is No.

Hypothesis: A it's widest point, Juptier and I wa morre htan five feet long.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "At it's widest point, Jupiter and Io was more than five feet long.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce how long Jupiter and lo was or get some bounds on the same. As stated by the premise, it can be understood that Jupiter and Lo is a painting (medium Oil on Canvas) with dimensions 163.5 cm by 70.5 cm. So it's widest point is at least 163.5 cm which is roughly 5.34 feet by common knowledge. This is indeed greater than 5 feet and so this implies the hypothesis is clearly true. The answer is Yes.

Premise:    Kazakh Khanate is a country.  The common languages of Kazakh Khanate is Kazakh language.  The khan of Kazakh Khanate are Janibek Khan Kerei Khan  (first) (1465-1480), Kenesary Khan (last) (1841-1847).  The established  was on 1465.   
Hypothesis: Kazakh Khanate only practiced Islam.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce which religions are practiced in Kazakh Khanate (country). The premise gives us no information of the same and it isn't very common knowledge either. Hence we are unable to make an inference of the hypothesis. The answer is Neutral.

Premise:    Joe Budden is a musician.  The birth name of Joe Budden is Joseph Anthony Budden II.  Joe Budden was born on ( 1980-08-31 )  August 31, 1980  (age 38)  New York, New York.  The labels of Joe Budden are Mood Muzik, EMPIRE (current), Desert Storm, Def Jam, Amalgam Digital, E1 (former).   
Hypothesis: Joe Budden is a black guy from the United States.
To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce whether Joe Budden is a black guy and if he is from the United States. Although the premise states that Joe Budden was born in New York implying that he is from the United States, there is no way to infer from the premise whether he is black(race). Answer is neutral.

Premise:  Hoboken, New Jersey is a city.  The type of Hoboken, New Jersey is Faulkner Act (mayor–council).  The body of Hoboken, New Jersey is City Council.  The mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey is Ravinder Bhalla (term ends December 31, 2021). 
Hypothesis: Hoboken, New Jersey has five main leaders of the town.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce we need to find how many leaders does Hoboken, New Jersey has. In the premise, there is no information about number of main leaders in the Hoboken, New Jersey. Hence we are unable to make an inference of the hypothesis. The answer is Neutral.

Premise:  The official languages of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, English.

The government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is Devolved executive-led system within a socialist republic. 
Hypothesis: The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China grants official status to more than one language.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce how many languages are official in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. We can see in the premise that There are two official languages: English and Chinese. As the hypothesis says "more than one". As two is more than one, the answer is Yes.

Premise:    Jerusalem is a city.  The jewish of Jerusalem is 64%.  The time zone of Jerusalem is UTC+02:00 (IST, PST).  The area code of Jerusalem is +972-2.   
Hypothesis: Christians comprise a big part of the population of Jerusalem.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the population division in Jerusalem. As stated in the premise, Jewish (religion) constitutes 64 percent of the population in Jerusalem. Hence the hypothesis must be false as the Christians(religion) can't possibly constitute a big part of the population, as the majority is taken up by the Jewish. The answer is No.

Premise:    Johannes Gutenberg is a person.  The birth name of Johannes Gutenberg is Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg.  The occupation of Johannes Gutenberg are Engraver, inventor, printer.  Johannes Gutenberg was known for The invention of the movable-type printing press.    
Hypothesis: Johannes Gutenberg was a printer before he was an inventor.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce which occupations were practiced by Johannes Gutenberg and in which order i.e. timing. The premise tells us that Johannes Gutenberg indeed was an Engraver, inventor and a painter, but it does not mention the order of the same and which occupation he took up. Since there is no information of the timing or timeline of the occupation, we are unable to state with certainty whether he was a painter "before" or "after" he was an inventor and it isn't very common knowledge either. Hence we are unable to make an inference of the hypothesis. The answer is Neutral.

To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce whether Ignacy Moscicki led Canada and if so then for how long. The premise states that Ignacy Moscicki was succeeded by Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz (President of the Polish Republic in Exile). We can hence infer that Ignacy Moscicki led Poland and not Canada. The hypothesis is hence clearly false. Answer is No.

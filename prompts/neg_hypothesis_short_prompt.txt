Premise:  The urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi).  The municipality of Heraklion is 244.6 km 2  (94.4 sq mi).  The municipal unit of Heraklion is 109.0 km 2  (42.1 sq mi).  The highest elevation of Heraklion is 33 m (108 ft). 
Hypothesis: The urban area doesn't cover over 90 , 000 square miles .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the coverage of the urban area. As stated in the premise, the urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi). 87.095 square miles is the urban area which satisfies the hypothesis of not covering over 90,000 miles as 87,095 is not greater than 90,000. The answer is Yes.

Premise:  Carrie & Lowell was released on March 31, 2015 (2015-03-31).  The recorded of Carrie & Lowell is Mid-2014.  The studio of Carrie & Lowell are Flora (Portland, Oregon), Black Watch (Norman, Oklahoma), April Base (Eau Claire, Wisconsin), Pat Dillett's studio (Midtown Manhattan), Stevens' office (Dumbo, Brooklyn), Hotel room (Klamath Falls, Oregon).  The producer of Carrie & Lowell is Thomas Bartlett.  
Hypothesis: More of Carrie & Lowell was not produced in the hotel room in Oregon than any other studio .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce in which locations Carrie & Lowell was produced and for how long. Although the premise mentions the locations, it provides no indication of how much time was spent in these locations and how much of Carrie & Lowell was produced in these places. We can't make a clear inference. The answer is neutral.

Hypothesis: Dennis Gabor's wife didn't outlive him by two years .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce how long Dennis Gabor lived in comparison to his wife. The premise states that Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979. It also states that his wife was Marjorie Louise Butler who died in 1981, this can be understood from the range 1911-1981 given next to her name. Therefore the hypothesis stating that Dennis Gabor's wife did not outlive him by to years is false. The answer is No.

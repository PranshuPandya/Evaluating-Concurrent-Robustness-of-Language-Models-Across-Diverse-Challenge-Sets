Premise:    The spouse(s) of Fawad Khan is Sadaf Khan ( m.  2005).  The labels of Fawad Khan are Lips Music (2002 - 2007) , Independent (2009 - 2015).  The years active of Fawad Khan was on 2001 - present.  Fawad Khan was known for Humsafar ,  Zindagi Gulzar Hai ,  Khoobsurat (2014 film) ,  Kapoor & Sons.   
Hypothesis: Fawad Khan married his spouse before he became active in the entertainment industry.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce when Fawad Khan was married and when he became active in the entertainment industry. The premise states that Fawad Khan has been married since 2005 this is what m. 2005 refers to. Also the premise states that Fawad Khan has had a label Lips Music from 2002-2007. This means that he was active in the entertainment industry since 2002 or before and got married in 2005. Hence the hypothesis stating that he married his spouse before becoming active in the entertainment industry is false since 2005 (year when he married spouse) is greater than 2002 (year since he was active in entertainment industry).The answer is No.

Premise:    Johannes Gutenberg is a person.  The birth name of Johannes Gutenberg is Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg.  The occupation of Johannes Gutenberg are Engraver, inventor, printer.  Johannes Gutenberg was known for The invention of the movable-type printing press.    
Hypothesis: Johannes Gutenberg was a printer before he was an inventor.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce which occupations were practiced by Johannes Gutenberg and in which order i.e. timing. The premise tells us that Johannes Gutenberg indeed was an Engraver, inventor and a painter, but it does not mention the order of the same and which occupation he took up. Since there is no information of the timing or timeline of the occupation, we are unable to state with certainty whether he was a painter "before" or "after" he was an inventor and it isn't very common knowledge either. Hence we are unable to make an inference of the hypothesis. The answer is Neutral.

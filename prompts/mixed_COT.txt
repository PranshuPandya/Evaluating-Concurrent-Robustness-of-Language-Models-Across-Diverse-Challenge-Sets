Premise:    Interior is a painting.  The artist of Interior is Edgar Degas.  The medium of Interior is Oil on canvas.  The location of Interior is Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.    
Hypothesis: The interior is presently on display in a museum in the United States.
To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce whether The interior is presently on display in a museum and whether that museum is in the United States. The premise clearly states that The Interior is a painting whose location is the Philadelphia Museum of Art,Philadeplphia, Pennsylvania, USA clearly stating that it is indeed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art and in the United States (USA). Answer is yes.

Premise:    The type of Kas is Soft drink.  The manufacturer of Kas is PepsiCo.  The country of origin of Kas is Spain.  The flavour of Kas are Orange, Lemon, Apple, Guarana, Guarana with Acerola, Guarana with Maracuja, Guarana with Peach.   
Hypothesis: PepiCo has Ltuck o tis origoinal formula for KaO with no changes.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "PepsiCo has stuck to its original formula for Kas with no changes.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce whether PepsiCo has stuck to the original formula for Kas or if it has undergone some modifications. The premise states that there are multiple flavours for Kas, from this we can infer that Kas has undergone many changes and PepsiCo has not stuck to the original formula for Kas. Hence the corrected hypothesis is false. The answer is No.

Premise:  The official languages of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, English.  The regional language of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is Cantonese.  The official scripts of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China are Traditional Chinese, English alphabet.  The government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is Devolved executive-led system within a socialist republic. 
Hypothesis: The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China grants official status to more than one language.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce how many languages are official in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. We can see in the premise that There are two official languages: English and Chinese. As the hypothesis says "more than one". As two is more than one, the answer is Yes.

Premise:  I and the Village is a painting.  The artist of I and the Village is Marc Chagall.  The medium of I and the Village is Oil on canvas.  The location of I and the Village is Museum of Modern Art, NY.  
Hypothesis: The museum in which this painting is hung is located in Lawrence.
To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce where the painting which is being talked about in the premise is hung. The premise clearly states that the location is the museum of Modern Art, NY (New York which can be inferred from common external knowledge). The hypothesis is hence clearly false. Answer is No.

Premise:  The urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi).  The municipality of Heraklion is 244.6 km 2  (94.4 sq mi).  The municipal unit of Heraklion is 109.0 km 2  (42.1 sq mi).  The highest elevation of Heraklion is 33 m (108 ft). 
Hypothesis: The urban area doesn't cover over 90 , 000 square miles .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce the coverage of the urban area. As stated in the premise, the urban area of Heraklion is 225,574 km 2  (87,095 sq mi). 87.095 square miles is the urban area which satisfies the hypothesis of not covering over 90,000 miles as 87,095 is not greater than 90,000. The answer is Yes.

Premise:    The born of Dennis Gabor is Günszberg Dénes , (1900-06-05)5 June 1900 , Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary.  Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979(1979-02-09) (aged 78) , London, England.  The spouse(s) of Dennis Gabor is Marjorie Louise Butler ( m. 1936) (1911-1981).  The awards of Dennis Gabor was on FRS (1956), Young Medal and Prize (1967), Rumford Medal (1968), IEEE Medal of Honor (1970), Nobel Prize in Physics (1971).   
Hypothesis: Dennis Gabor's wife didn't outlive him by two years .
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce how long Dennis Gabor lived in comparison to his wife. The premise states that Dennis Gabor died on 9 February 1979. It also states that his wife was Marjorie Louise Butler who died in 1981, this can be understood from the range 1911-1981 given next to her name. Therefore the hypothesis stating that Dennis Gabor's wife did not outlive him by to years is false. The answer is No.

Premise:  The alma mater of Bruce Lee is University of Washington.  Bruce Lee was born as Lee Jun-fan November 27, 1940  San Francisco, California, U.S..  Bruce Lee died on July 20, 1973 (1973-07-20)  (aged 32)  Kowloon Tong, British Hong Kong.  The resting place of Bruce Lee is Lake View Cemetery, Seattle, U.S.. 
Hypothesis: Bruce Lee lived in Jackson at the time of his death.
To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce where Bruce Lee lived at the time of his death. Although the premise mentions that he died at Kowloon Tong, British Hong Kong and that his resting place (burial) is at Lake View Cemetery in the United States (US), it makes no mention of his place of living during his death. We can't make a clear inference. Answer is Neutral.

Premise:    The year of Jupiter and Io is c. 1532-1533.  The medium of Jupiter and Io is Oil on canvas.  The dimensions of Jupiter and Io is 163.5 cm  70.5 cm (64.4 in  27.8 in).  The location of Jupiter and Io is Kunsthistorisches Museum.    
Hypothesis: A it's widest point, Juptier and I wa morre htan five feet long.
The hypothesis looks like it has typos. The correct hypothesis from common knowledge and taking hints from the premise, should've been "At it's widest point, Jupiter and Io was more than five feet long.". To make an inference, we need to either directly know or deduce how long Jupiter and lo was or get some bounds on the same. As stated by the premise, it can be understood that Jupiter and Lo is a painting (medium Oil on Canvas) with dimensions 163.5 cm by 70.5 cm. So it's widest point is at least 163.5 cm which is roughly 5.34 feet by common knowledge. This is indeed greater than 5 feet and so this implies the hypothesis is clearly true. The answer is Yes.

Premise:    Kappa Coronae Borealis b is a planet.  The constellation of Kappa Coronae Borealis b is Coronae Borealis.  The declination of Kappa Coronae Borealis b is +35  39' 26.575".  The spectral type of Kappa Coronae Borealis b is K11Va.    
Hypothesis: Kappa Coronae Borealis b is a celestial object.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce what Kappa Coronae Borealis b is. The premise clearly states that Kappa Coronae Borealis b is a planet, which indeed is a celestial object by very common knowledge. Hence the hypothesis stating that Kappa Coronae Borealis b is a celestial object is true. The answer is yes.

Premise:  I'm So Sick was chronology on Do You Hear What I Hear? (2005), I'm So Sick (2006), Fully Alive (2006).  The album of I'm So Sick is Flyleaf.  I'm So Sick was released on August 29, 2006.  I'm So Sick was recorded on May 2005 at Seattle, Washington. 
Hypothesis: I'm So Sick was recorded in in 2365.
To make an inference about the hypothesis, we need to either know directly or deduce when was "I'm So Sick" was recorded. We can see from the premise that "I'm So Sick" was recorded in 2005, where as in the hypothesis it mentions the year 2365. So the hypothesis contradict the premise and thus the answer for this should be No.
